[DEMO](https://github.com/gmourier/productizer-bot/discussions/2)

A simple bot that helps product teams manage feedback from Github discussions to stay in sync with ProductBoard.

- The bot comments a gentle message after the discussion has been created.
- The bot sends every comment content as a new note to ProductBoard. (except its own)
    - `origin:github` and `waiting:triage` tags are set on ProductBoard notes.
    - `display_url` ProductBoard Note's field is filled with the Github comment link.
